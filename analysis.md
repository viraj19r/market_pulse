### Basket Analysis
- Analyze the combinations of products that are frequently bought together.
- This can help in optimizing product bundling, cross-selling, and up-selling strategies.


### Segmentation Analysis
- Break down data into meaningful segments such as customer demographics, product categories, and brand scale.
- This will help identify which segments are performing well and which need improvement.


### <span style="color: red;">Brand Performance</span>
- Analyze the performance of products across different brands (using `brand` and `brand_scale`) to identify which brands are leading in terms of sales, customer ratings, and review counts.
- This could inform brand partnerships or product stocking decisions.


### Category and Subcategory Analysis
- Evaluate sales and customer ratings across different category and `product_subcategory` segments to identify high-performing and underperforming segments.
- This can guide inventory management and marketing efforts.


### Seasonal Trends and Product Performance
- Use `seasonal_indicator` to analyze how seasonality affects the sales and popularity of products.
- This can help in planning inventory and marketing strategies around seasonal peaks.


### Promotion Effectiveness
- Compare products with `promotion_indicator` set to 'Yes' versus 'No' to assess how promotions impact sales volume and customer ratings.
- This can optimize promotional strategies.


### Shipping Weight Analysis
- Investigate if there's a correlation between `shipping_weight` and customer satisfaction or sales volume.
- This might reveal if customers prefer lighter, more convenient products or if heavier products are perceived as better quality.


### Product Bundle Performance
- Compare the performance of `bundle_indicator` (individual vs. bundle) to see if bundled products perform better in terms of sales and customer ratings than individual products.


### Customer Feedback and Product Ratings
- Correlate `customer_reviews_count` and `product_rating` with sales data to determine if higher ratings and more reviews lead to better sales performance.


### Customer Demographics and Product Preferences
- Explore `customer_demographics` to identify which demographic segments are most engaged with different types of products.
- This could inform targeted marketing campaigns.


### Sentiment Analysis on Product Descriptions and Reviews
- Perform natural language processing (NLP) to analyze sentiment in `product_description` and customer reviews.
- This can identify what features or attributes are most positively or negatively mentioned and how this correlates with sales and ratings.


### Network Analysis of Bundled Products
- If products are often sold together, use network analysis to identify clusters of products that form a 'bundle network'.
- This can reveal how different products are interconnected and can influence each other's sales.


### Cross-Category Elasticity Analysis
- Investigate how changes in price or sales volume in one category affect sales in other categories, identifying cross-category demand elasticity.
- This helps in understanding the interdependencies between different product categories.


### Weighted Product Performance Score
- Develop a composite score for each product that weights various factors like sales volume, customer ratings, discount depth, and review count.
- This score can help prioritize products based on their overall market performance.
